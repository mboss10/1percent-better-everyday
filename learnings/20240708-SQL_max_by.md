# SQL MAX_BY() function

MAX_BY() is like MAX(), but you can use it to simplify queries that involve grouping. Here's how:

MAX(load_weight) - this gives us the largest value in the "load_weight" column.

MAX_BY(load_type, load_weight) - this gives us the value in the "load_type" column whose load_weight = MAX(load_weight).

If we didn't use MAX_BY(), our query would be more complicated! One strategy to find the label of the load_type with the MAX() load_weight would be to use a subquery in the WHERE clause or a CTE. This pattern is common, but could be a bit messy to read.

To make your query simpler and more readable, just use MAX_BY() instead! Of course, there's also a MIN_BY() function that works the same way.

Important notes: 
- if there's a tie, MAX_BY() only returns one row, but using the WHERE clause will return multiple rows.
- MAX_BY() is not a standard SQL function and may not be available in all SQL databases - works in BigQuery. 

## Test in my BigQuery instance

Using the `austin_waste` dataset, I ran the following query to find the load_type that has the largest load_weight in the table.

```
SELECT max_by(load_type, load_weight) as heaviest_load_type FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_waste.waste_and_diversion`
```
