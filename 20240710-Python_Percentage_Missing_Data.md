# Finding the Percentage of Missing Data Using a Pandas DataFrame

Before diving into data analysis, it is crucial to assess data quality and identify which columns have missing data. This ensures the reliability of your insights and guides you on data cleaning efforts.

## San Francisco Building Permits Sample File

To illustrate this method, we'll use the [San Francisco Building Permits file available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). This dataset contains details of all types of structural permits issued from January 1, 2013, to February 25, 2018. It includes application/permit numbers, job addresses, supervisorial districts, and the current status of applications.  
This file has a significant amount of NULL/missing data in several columns, making it an excellent example for demonstrating how to identify missing data.

## The Classic Way

Assuming we have loaded the data into a DataFrame called `sf_permits`, we can use the `info()` method to get an overview of the number of complete entries in each column.

```python
sf_permits.info()
```

This command will provide a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null entries per column. Here's a sample output:

![info_output](path_to_info_image)

## Going Beyond the `.info()`

To get a clearer and more detailed picture of missing data, we can calculate the percentage of missing entries for each column. This method allows us to see which columns have the most missing data, helping prioritize data cleaning tasks.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
# Calculating the percentage of missing data for each column
missing_data_percentage = (sf_permits.isnull().sum() / sf_permits.isnull().count()).sort_values(ascending=False)
print(missing_data_percentage)
```

This code calculates the percentage of missing values for each column and sorts the results in descending order, making it easy to identify the columns with the highest proportion of missing data.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

![missing_data_output](path_to_missing_data_image)

## Conclusion

Identifying the percentage of missing data in your dataset is an essential step in the data preparation process. By understanding the extent of missing values, you can make informed decisions on how to handle them, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your data analysis.
