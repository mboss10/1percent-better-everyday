# SQL MAX_BY() function

MAX_BY() is like MAX(), but you can use it to simplify queries that involve grouping. Here's how:

MAX(price) - this gives us the largest value in the "price" column.

MAX_BY(vegetable, price) - this gives us the value in the "vegetable" column whose price = MAX(price).

If we didn't use MAX_BY(), our query would be more complicated! One strategy to find the name of the vegetable with the MAX() price would be to use a subquery in the WHERE clause or a CTE. This pattern is common, but it's a bit messy to read.

To make your query simpler and more readable, just use MAX_BY() instead! Of course, there's also a MIN_BY() function that works the same way.

Important notes: 
- if there's a tie, MAX_BY() only returns one row, but using the WHERE clause will return multiple rows.
- MAX_BY() is not a standard SQL function and may not be available in all SQL databases.
